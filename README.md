Spectral Plotter
  By Abigail Basener, Summer 2024, for GTA

The Spectral Plotter is a Python application designed for visualizing reflectance spectra of vegetation. It provides functionality to plot spectral data, annotate key features with vertical lines, and shade specific wavelength ranges of interest.
Use the example calls in ExampleCall to understand how to use annotedPlot.py.

You will need:
    Veg1.xlsx: Excel file containing features to label.
    name.hdr: HDR file that will be referenced (make sure to update the file name in the code).

Features
    Plotting Spectra: Visualizes reflectance spectra using matplotlib.
    Annotating Features: Adds vertical lines and annotations to highlight specific spectral features.
    Shading Regions: Shades specified wavelength ranges to emphasize spectral bands of interest.
